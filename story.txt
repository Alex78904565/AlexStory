     Cindy really loved puppies. She'd often think to herself, "Puppies are the cutest thing in the whole world!" When she was at home, she used to search google just to find photos of puppies to look at. Unfortunately, her behavior started to become problematic. Cindy started to chew up the furniture at home. Chairs, stools, couches, everything in her sight. This puppy became a lot more expensive than I had expected.
