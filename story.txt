     Cindy really loved puppies. She'd often think to herself, "Puppies are the cutest thing in the whole world!" When she was at home, she used to search google just to find photos of puppies to look at. Unfortunately, her behavior started to become problematic. Cindy started to chew up the furniture at home. Chairs, stools, couches, everything in her sight. This puppy became a lot more expensive than I had expected.
	Her parents came home from work that day and found the mess that Cindy had made. "Oh my! What happened to our daughter!" yelled Cindy's dad. Her parents knew they had to stop Cindy from turning into a puppy. Quickly, they rushed out of their home with Cindy.         They take Cindy to UHS mental health department, and Cindy gets help from a very nicedoctor who knows how to help her with the best way. They adpot a cute puppy from one of the animal shelter and Cindy has her best friend from now.
